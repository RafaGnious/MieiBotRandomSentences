# MieiBotRandomSentences
My first rust project: a simple discord bot
This bot will reply with a random sentence to anyone who doesn't have a specific role

# Instructions
Clone the repository

Copy the Settings_example.json file and rename it to Settings.json

In the Settings.json set the "token" to your bot's token

In the Settings.json set the "role_id" to the specified role

Additionally you can add sentences to "random_sentences" or remove the ones already given. Keep in mind any {} in the sentences will be replaced by the target user's username
